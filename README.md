<h2>Features</h2> 
<b>Search by Category:</b> Users may see goods from a certain apparel category by selecting one from the dropdown menu and clicking the "Search" button.

<b>Product Display:</b> The retrieved goods are presented in a visually pleasing grid style, complete with product photos, names, and pricing.

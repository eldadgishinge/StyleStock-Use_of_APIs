#StyleStock

E-commerce Website
This project is a basic e-commerce store web application that allows customers to search for and view product information for various sorts of clothing. The program retrieves product data from the "Fake Store API" and presents it in a neat grid arrangement.

Features
Search by Category: Users may see goods from a certain apparel category by selecting one from the dropdown menu and clicking the "Search" button.

Product Display: The retrieved goods are presented in a visually pleasing grid style, complete with product photos, names, and pricing.

Product Interaction: Users can mimic adding a product to the basket by clicking the "Add to Cart" button (an alert is presented for demonstration reasons).

Usage
Launch a web browser and navigate to index.html.

Select a clothing category from the dropdown menu.

To view items from the specified category, click the "Search" button.

Click the "Add to Cart" button to interact with the shown goods.

The product data was provided via "Fake Store API" using HTML CSS JavaScript.

Disclaimer
This is a basic example that excludes genuine e-commerce capabilities like as cart management, payment processing, and user identification. It provides as an example of how to use APIs to retrieve and show product data.
